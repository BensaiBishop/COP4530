
Analyze the worst-case run-time complexities of the member functions reverse() and remove_if().
for reverse()

Reverse would start from the head and make its way to nullptr while still in the loop, it should be O(n),
	where n is the number of elements in the list or nodes.
Remove_if would be similar as it runs through the list checking for the matchin criteria, this loop ends
	once it reached the end of the list. It should be 0(n) where n is the number of elements in the list.
