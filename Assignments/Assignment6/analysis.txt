For the reading of the input set.
The reading is contained in a single while loop so the Big O would be O(n).

For storing the characters in a map.
Would be O(log N), due to the complexity of the insert function.

Final tracking of in on the data types, due nested for loop the complexity would be O(n^2).
As well as the deciding of top ten would be O(n^2).
